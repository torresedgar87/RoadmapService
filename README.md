Some idead to improve this service
1. Creating composite requests https://www.subbu.org/blog/2011/03/performance-of-restful-apps
2. Database connection pooling, supported in Tomcat/Glassfish
3. OAuth2 to allow for facebook signin, but maybe look into some real authorization framework.
4. ORM? this is debateable, will it work for our project?
